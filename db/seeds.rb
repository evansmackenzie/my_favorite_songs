# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# songs = Song.create(title: "Modern Love", album: "Let's Dance", artist: "David Bowie", year: "1983")

# songs = Song.create(title: "Age of consent", album: "Power, Corruption, & Lies", artist: "New Order", year: "1983")
